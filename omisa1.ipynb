    "e)the most sensible prices to implement would ideally follow the logic of (d), as there's a clear differentiation in pricing both within each product line and across product lines for the same versions, reflecting both product value and strategic market positioning. This approach ensures logical price progression within each product line also positions different product lines in the market, reflecting their value and brand prestige accurately. It's a more comprehensive and market-aware strategy that likely aligns better with consumer expectations and competitive dynamics."
