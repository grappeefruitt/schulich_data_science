    "e)In practice, the most sensible prices to implement would ideally follow the logic of (d), where there's a clear differentiation in pricing both within each product line and across product lines for the same versions, reflecting both product value and strategic market positioning. However, it's critical to ensure that the optimization model correctly implements these constraints and that the output accurately reflects this logic. The reported identical prices for all versions in the FusionBook line under (d) suggest a need to revisit the model or output interpretation to ensure it aligns with practical business strategies and product differentiation goals."
